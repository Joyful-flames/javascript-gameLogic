Its range extends across coastal northern Australia from the Richmond River in New South Wales to Shark Bay in Western Australia.\n\nRed mangrove forms extensive, often pure stands around the shores of shallow protected bays, estuaries and inlets. It prefers soft, well drained muddy soils. It also establishes on rock or coral-based sandy soils and is a dominant species of lower tidal mangrove forests. It is commonly seen along the lower tidal reaches of rivers and immediately behind the seaward fringe of mangroves, sometimes with grey and yellow mangroves."

The smooth bark is shed in strips and has a mottled appearance with patches of yellow, pinkish grey, reddish grey, bluish grey and white. The juvenile leaves are linear to narrowly lance-shaped, up to 9cm long by 1.4cm wide, greyish-green in colour and arranged at first in opposite pairs then alternating along the branch. The dull, green, adult leaves are lance-shaped and measure up to 13cm long by 1.3cm wide. A prominent feature of the leaves is the intramarginal vein being remote from the leaf edge.\nThe white flowers are grouped in clusters of seven on a stalk measuring up to 1.2cm long that grows from where the leaf joins with a branchlet. Mature flower buds are egg-shaped or spherical, and are up to 4mm long with a rounded cap. The seed capsules are hemispherical to cup-shaped and are 2.5-5mm long by 4-7mm diameter with 4-6 valves opening at rim level or slightly exserted.

It can form thickets of seedlings beneath planted trees from which the species may expand and exclude other vegetation., Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) is regarded as an environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland. Though this species has been widely and commonly cultivated throughout Australia for many years, it was first recorded as becoming naturalised in Queensland in 1987. It has spread from cultivation into nearby open woodlands and grasslands, particularly on creekbanks and near waterways., Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) was recently ranked among the top 200 most important environmental weeds in south-eastern Queensland. It appears on numerous local environmental weed lists in this region (e.g. in Ipswich City, Redland Shire and Caboolture Shire) and has been recorded in eucalypt forest on the Gold Coast., This species is also widely regarded as an environmental weed in north-eastern New South Wales (e.g. in the Byron, Lismore and Tweed Shires) and is also seen as a potential environmental weed in the wider Sydney and Blue Mountains region. Though it rarely reaches maturity in these cooler areas, naturalised plants have been reported in grasslands and woodlands in suburban Sydney., Jacaranda mimosifolia is very difficult to control once established. Large trees must be ring-barked or cut down below ground level and any regrowth treated with herbicide. . When using any herbicide always read the label first and follow all instructions and safety requirements. If in doubt consult an expert."
